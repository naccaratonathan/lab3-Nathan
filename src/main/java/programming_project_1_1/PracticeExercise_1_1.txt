You want to decide whether you should drive your car to work or take the train.
You know the one-way distance from your home to your place of work, and the fuel efficiency 
of your car (in miles per gallon). You also know the one-way price of a train ticket. 
You assume the cost of gas at $4 per gallon, and car maintenance at 5 cents per mile. 
Write an algorithm to decide which commute is cheaper.

Your answer in pseudocode below:


Create a variable for the distance from home to work
Fuel efficiency in miles per gallon
Create a variable for train ticket
To calculate the number of gallons needed to get to work, divide the distance by miles per gallon
Then to get your maintenance cost you, multiply the distance by the maintenance cost per mile
 To get total gas cost you would  multiply the gallons by the cost of gas
 Add the maintenance and the total gas cost for the total upkeep of the car
 Then compare the total car price to train ticket price

if car price is lower than train ticket print out take the car
else print to take the train
